Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later. Version control systems are a category of software tools that help a software team manage changes to source code over time. Version control software keeps track of every modification to the code in a special kind of database. If a mistake is made, developers can turn back the clock and compare earlier versions of the code to help fix the mistake while minimizing disruption to all team members. Software developers working in teams are continually writing new source code and changing existing source code. The code for a project, app or software component is typically organized in a folder structure or "file tree". One developer on the team may be working on a new feature while another developer fixes an unrelated bug by changing code, each developer may make their changes in several parts of the file tree.

Benefits of version control systems:

Developing software without using version control is risky, like not having backups. Version control can also enable developers to move faster and it allows software teams to preserve efficiency and agility as the team scales to include more developers. 2.A complete long-term change history of every file. 3.Branching and merging. 4.Traceability. Being able to trace each change made to the software and connect it to project management and bugs
Note:While it is possible to develop software without using any version control, doing so subjects the project to a huge risk that no professional team would be advised to accept.
